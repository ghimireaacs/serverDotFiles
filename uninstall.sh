# Userland teardown for shell environment.
#
# This script reverses the changes made by install.sh.
# It removes symlinks created by this repository and
# optionally restores previous backups.
#
# Scope:
# - Remove symlinked dotfiles managed by this repo
# - Restore backed-up files if present
# - Does NOT remove Oh My Zsh, plugins, or system packages
#
# This script is safe to run multiple times.
